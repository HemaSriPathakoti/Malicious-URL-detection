As the internet continues to grow, so do the threats posed by harmful websites. Many attackers use malicious URLs to trick users into clicking on links that lead to phishing attacks, malware downloads, or other harmful actions. The aim of this project is to develop a system that can automatically detect and block these dangerous URLs using machine learning techniques. This project aims to create a system that can detect and prevent malicious URLs using machine learning. By analysing patterns and behaviours in URLs, the system will identify potential threats. Machine learning techniques like Random Forests will help the system learn and improve its detection accuracy. Through rigorous testing and evaluation, our proposed system demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency in detecting a wide range of cyber threats. By URL analysis, the system provides a comprehensive solution to the growing problem of malicious links, contributing significantly to the protection of users from cyberattacks.
